# 🏟️ Sports Link

Sports Link is a modern Android application that enables users to create, discover, and join sports events with ease.
Built using Jetpack Compose and the MVI (Model–View–Intent) architecture, the app focuses on predictable state management, scalable architecture, and a smooth user experience.

Users can securely register and sign in using Firebase Authentication, browse available sports events, and apply advanced filters to find events that match their preferences. They can also leave joined events and delete hosted events.
